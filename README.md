Introduction
The goal of my project is to analyze the post-pandemic global job market for Data Scientists and compare it to the global job market during the same time period, as represented by global layoff data. 
When I saw that these datasets were available, my interest was piqued by the possibility of examining the job prospects in my chosen field for myself, without the biases that might be present in analyses done by institutions of higher education or industry think tanks. 
I hope the data shows that the career I chose is growing (i.e., there are many jobs and salaries are increasing) and stable (relatively insulated from downturns in the wider economy). 
Did I choose a good career path with good pay and prospects, or did I jump on the wrong ship, overly beholden to the winds and tides of the broader economy and at risk of sinking? Iâ€™ll find out.

Questions of Interest

  What is the yearly trend of Data Scientist salaries and layoffs?
  What is the trend of Data Scientist salaries in different countries, and are there any countries with significantly stronger or weaker job markets for Data Scientists?
  What industries are seeing the most layoffs, and do any industries in particular show trends that correlate to the Data Science job market?
  How was the Data Science Market affected by layoffs (correlation between salaries, jobs, and layoffs)? Only correlation with layoffs in certain industries?
  Did the high rate of remote job hiring during the pandemic result in mass layoffs in the post-COVID work environment?
